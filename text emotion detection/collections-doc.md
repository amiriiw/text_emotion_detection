## What is collections?

The "collections" module in Python provides specialized container datatypes as alternatives to the general-purpose
built-in containers like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. It includes high-performance data structures beyond the
built-in types, offering additional functionality for specific use cases.


## Why do we use collections?

We use the collections library in Python to work with specialized data structures that are not available in the standard
built-in types. These data structures provide efficient ways to store and manipulate data, making it easier to write 
clean and optimized code for various programming tasks.


## Advantages of collections:

- Specialized data structures: The collections library offers specialized data structures like named tuples, deque, 
Counter, OrderedDict, and defaultdict, which can simplify programming tasks and improve code readability.


- Performance optimizations: Some data structures in the collections library are optimized for specific operations, 
leading to better performance compared to using standard built-in types.


- Enhanced functionality: The collections library provides additional functionalities that are not available in the
standard containers, allowing for more efficient data manipulation and organization.


## Disadvantages of collections:

- Learning curve: Understanding the specific use cases and functionalities of each data structure in the collections library may require some learning for beginners.


- Overhead: In some cases, using specialized data structures from the collections library may introduce additional overhead compared to using standard built-in types, especially for simple data storage needs.


## Summary about collections:

The Python collections library offers specialized data structures that provide enhanced functionality and performance
optimizations for various programming tasks. While it may have a learning curve and introduce some overhead in certain
scenarios, the collections library is a valuable tool for working with specific data organization and manipulation 
requirements in Python.
