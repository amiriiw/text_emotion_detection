## What is transformers?

Transformers are electrical devices that are used to transfer electrical energy between two or more circuits through 
electromagnetic induction. They consist of two coils of wire, known as the primary and secondary coils, which are 
magnetically coupled but electrically isolated.


## Why do we use transformers?

Transformers are used to step up or step down voltage levels in electrical systems. This is important for transmitting 
electricity over long distances with minimal loss, as well as for matching the voltage requirements of different 
devices.


## Advantages of transformers:

- Efficient energy transfer: Transformers have high efficiency in transferring electrical energy from one circuit to
another.


- Voltage regulation: Transformers can be used to regulate voltage levels, ensuring that devices receive the correct
amount of power.- 


- Isolation: Transformers provide electrical isolation between the input and output circuits, enhancing safety.


## Disadvantages of transformers:

- Size and weight: Transformers can be bulky and heavy, especially for high-power applications.


- Cost: Transformers can be expensive to manufacture and maintain.


- Energy losses: Transformers can experience energy losses in the form of heat during operation.


## Summary about transformers:
Transformers are essential components in electrical systems for voltage transformation, energy transfer, and voltage 
regulation. They offer advantages such as efficient energy transfer, voltage regulation, and electrical isolation, 
but also have disadvantages related to size, cost, and energy losses. Overall, transformers play a crucial role in
modern electrical infrastructure.
