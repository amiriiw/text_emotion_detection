## What is Torch?

The Torch library in Python, commonly known as PyTorch, is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch
library originally developed for Lua programming language. It provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph 
structure, making it popular for deep learning research and development.


## Why do we use Torch?

We use the Torch library in Python for various machine learning tasks, especially deep learning. It offers a range of 
tools and functionalities that make it easier to build and train neural networks. PyTorch is known for its ease of use, 
flexibility, and excellent support for dynamic computation graphs.
Advantages of the Torch library:

- Easy to use: PyTorch provides a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for beginners to get started with deep learning.


- Dynamic computation graph: PyTorch allows for dynamic graph computation, enabling more flexibility in model building and debugging.


- Strong community support: PyTorch has a large and active community, providing resources, tutorials, and libraries to support users.


- Integration with Python: Being a Python library, PyTorch seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries and frameworks.


## Disadvantages of Torch:

- Performance: While PyTorch is known for its flexibility, it may not always offer the best performance compared to other deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow for certain tasks.


- Deployment: Deployment of PyTorch models can sometimes be more challenging compared to other frameworks like TensorFlow, especially in production environments.


## Summary about Torch:

PyTorch, the Torch library in Python, is a powerful tool for deep learning research and development. It offers ease of 
use, flexibility with dynamic computation graphs, strong community support, and seamless integration with Python. 
However, users should consider performance and deployment challenges when choosing PyTorch for their projects.
